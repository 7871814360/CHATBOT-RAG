          "Preamble - India has a robust Startup ecosystem that has the potential to make the country a Superpower. It is described as “the poster child” of emerging markets for its vast commercial potential for Startups. Preamble India, though the third largest economy in the world, is ranked fourth in the Asia-Pacific Startup Ecosystem only next to Singapore, Australia and China as per the Startup Ecosystem Report, 2022, and expected to contribute 15% to the global growth in the coming years. \nTamil Nadu is one of the most progressive States in the country and has been the engine of the nation’s economic growth. It is on the frontline in all development parameters. With 4% of the nations land mass and 6% of the nations population, the State contributes 9% of the nations GDP. The States vision of reaching the US$ One Trillion economy is supported by its varied strengths. According to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2022, Tamil Nadu has the highest number of institutions among the top 100 ranking; in the Ease of Doing Business, Tamil Nadu ranks third with the creation of the Single Window Portal Clearance. Aiding this development and concentrating on equitable progress, Tamil Nadu is a pioneer State in the country to establish Social Justice Schemes. The State has formulated policies and schemes that ensure socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. There has been a tremendous push for infrastructure development and job creation in the State in the last two years. It is the knowledge hub of the country and about a million graduates get added to the talent pool every year. The State also has the largest annual turnout of skilled workforce in the country. Tamil Nadu is ranked among the top three States in research and development in the country.Tamil Nadu has a vibrant Startup ecosystem that nurtures social entrepreneurship at its core. The State is represented by Chennai and Coimbatore as two of the top 400 Startup Cities Globally as per the Blink Startup Ecosystem Report, 2022. The Indian Startup Ecosystem Report 2022 ranks Chennai as the countrys fourth top Startup hub. Coimbatore, Madurai, Tiruchi, Salem and Vellore are recognised as emerging hubs. Overall, Tamil Nadu offers fundamentally sound building blocks necessary to create a distinctive democratic Startup ecosystem. Tamil Nadu has witnessed a notable increase in the number of registered Startups, exceeding 7,000 in September 2023 and has attracted significant venture capital investments over the past two years. Tamil Nadu is now committed to attaining the top ranks in the National and International ecosystems, across measures, with the collaborative efforts of various stakeholders in the Startup ecosystem. \nThe policy period of the first Tamil Nadu Startup and Innovation Policy was 2018-23. The challenges exposed by the COVID pandemic and the fast-changing technological landscape now calls for more innovative and vigorous measures to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. Our startups are expected to be not just engines of economic growth; they are game changers in alleviating poverty, reducing inequality and increasing social mobility. The revamped Startup and Innovation Policy of the State will be the fuel to accelerate and scale Startups and increase their share in the States GDP as well as Social Capital.\n The main focus of this policy framework is to establish a democratised ecosystem that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship, transforming the State into a land of opportunities for the development of both technologically groundbreaking and socially impactful enterprises by individuals from all walks of life."
